# Project Proposal

## Collaboration

This proposal was worked on solo by Jessy Wang, github user: jwang9500

### Project title

Distractions and Dungeons

### What and why?

A gamified focus/habit builder app. The purpose is to help users stay on track and hold themselves accountable, with rewards (for that bonus hit of gratification after completeing a habit or study session), or negative effects (meant to reinforce the behaviors users are trying to focus on). In a world where distractions are very prevalent, it's meant to be a tool to cut down on that noise.

### For whom?

This software would probably be for younger people, think high school/college aged students, who likely enjoy gaming in some shape or form, bonus if they like table top RPGs. The consumers would be people who have many little tasks to take care of in a day, or need a tool to block out sections of time to take care of studying, assignments, etc. Consumers would also be people who are motivated by streaks, keeping them alive, social accountability, and gamified rewards.

### How?

Background/theming draws heavily from adventure fantasy RPG backgrounds akin to Dungeons and Dragons and the like

Core Features
1. Character
    - A representation of the user that will grow and/or be customized as the user uses the app more successfully (completed studying sessions, rewards for completing habits/tasks, etc.)
2. Focus Timer
    - A timer the user can set to focus for an amount of time that the user determines. With pomodoro as an option (segmented amounts of time, ex: 25 min focus 5 min break)
    - Framed as quests that the user character sets out on for that ^ amount of time
    - A successful quest (user did not get distracted) would provide the user with rewards, with rewards scaling with the amount of time the quest took
3. Task List
    - A customizable list of tasks the user can edit and change, and check off when completed
    - On completion of a task, the user is provided with rewards
    - Tasks can be repeatable --> Forming and reinforcing habits
        - Repeatable tasks have bonus rewards scaling based on the number of times a task has been completed in a row (streak building)
        - This is broken when user does not complete the task one day

Stretch/More Advanced Features
1. Social Support
    - Shared Questing
        - Individual users should be able to join their timers together (think group study session), framed as questing with a party, with all participants getting rewards with a successful quest
        - Of course, if someone in the party gets distracted, this negatively impacts the entire group, thus making users hold themselves accountable
    - Guilds/Social Hubs
        - Users completing tasks together should unlock a weekly reward, further reinforce the habit building and add another layer of incentive to do so
        - These groups should be user created, a way for friends to work together on completeing tasks for a larger collective goal

### Scope

The core functionality of the app is very achieveable, a timer, a gamified reward system, and a way to keep track of habits/tasks. More advanced features increase the complexity of the project in a way that is challenging but manageable, with plenty of room for additional polish and changes depending on the team.
